CKS Exam Preparation Tips . Recently, I have completed Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) certification of The Linux Foundation. Here are a few tips for the exam which might help you as well to crack the same exam. . Course Taken . I have taken the following three courses before giving the exam. In these courses, I got practice material, hands-on lab and exam simulation environment which helped me to clear the CKS exam. . Kubernetes Security Essentials (LFS260) by THE LINUX FOUNDATION | Kubernetes CKS 2021 Complete Course - Theory - Practice by Kim Wüstkamp, Killer Shell | Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS) by William Boyd, A CLOUD GURU | . Vi / Vim Setting for yaml to Edit Comfortably &amp; Efficiently . Added few setting in .vimrc profile which help to edit yaml file effectively and efficiently. . cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;~/.vimrc set ts=2 sw=2 sts=2 et ai number syntax on EOF . Or may be follow below procedure: . echo &quot;set ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 et number&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.vimrc . While copying part of yaml from kubernetes.io site, enable paste mode first using :set paste which will keep source formatting. . Disable paste mode by using command: :set nopaste in vim command mode. Again turn on auto intendation mode using :set ai. . To indent multiple line, go to appropriate line and press :shift+v and select required line using up/down arrow keys. Then to indent the marked lines press &gt;or &lt; and to repeat same action use .. . Command Alias . In CKS exam environment, by default kubectl with k alias and bash autocompletion is configured. . Used below command alias to type command quickly and check various resources in a single command for a namespace. . cat &lt;&lt;EOF&gt;kalias.sh alias kgn=&quot;k get node&quot; alias aa=&#39;k get all,sa,ep,sc,pv,pvc,cm,netpol&#39; alias kn=&#39;k config set-context --current --namespace &#39; alias kcc=&#39;k config get-contexts&#39; # help to add parameter quickly with kubectl or k export do=&quot;--dry-run=client -o yaml&quot; o=&quot;-o wide&quot; y=&quot;-o yaml&quot; l=&quot;--show-labels&quot; EOF source kalias.sh . Tmux Setting . Tmux is a great tool but I havn’t used because copy and paste method is different than the normal termal. Also time is ticking and need to move quickly to answer all the questions….. . Bookmark Allowed Website: Important Content / Exam Objective Example (Mainly kubernetes.io) . In my bookmark manager, I added necessary sample yaml and exam objective topics from kubernetes and external allowed sites so that I could check content quickly when it is required to solve the exam question. . Lab Practice . At the end, do a lot of practice in your lab which will help to think and make an action plan for the question in the exam. To answer all the questions you have to act quickly and the allowed time is only 120 min which runs fast. . Use imperative command to create skeleton for pod or deployment and then modify/add extra parameters | Use imperative command to expose service | Use bash search command ctl+rto run previously executed command. | . During Exam . During the exam, first try to solve the question which has more weight compared to the lower weight question. . In this way, most likely, you will be able to avoid troubleshooting activity for the lower weight question if not solved in the first attempt or easily within your timeline. Because of exam pressure, sometimes you may give more time to lower weight questions, As a consequence, at the end you may not be able to give sufficient time to higher weight questions. .
